On our Canada tours you'll explore the picturesque isles and craggy shores in the east, dazzling mountain lakes and world-class resorts in the Canadian Rockies, cosmopolitan cities, and rugged Yukon Territory. Immerse yourself in the French ambiance of walled Quebec and the Gaspesian, charming Scottish Nova Scotia, or very British Victoria. Travel back to the golden era of luxury—on a Canada train trip, or come face to face with remote fishing villages, intricate totem poles carved by First Nations people, breathtaking national parks, and historic sites. You'll enjoy the must-see attractions—plus special experiences you won't get anywhere else…tour a traditional sugar shack to learn how maple syrup is made, visit a dogsled facility to meet the huskies and their trainers, and so much more. With Globous, you'll truly discover the undiscovered in Canada.",
